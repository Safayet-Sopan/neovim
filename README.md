# neovim ide
My Neovim configuration for IDE
Get a basic understanding of Neovim to proceed in this term.

Make a directory called nvim inside .config directory. Then add init.lua and other files. >> **DO NOT CREATE README.md FILE** <<

for mac users you can use
```touch filename``` in your terminal to create the files and ```mkdir foldername``` to create folders.

Ex: ```touch init.lua``` & ```mkdir lua```,```plugins```


You have to add LSP, DAP, LINTERS, FORMATTERS for programming laguages in lsp-config.lua, debugging.lua files.
